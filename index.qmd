About

Education

B.S. Animal Sciences and Marine Biology, University of Minnesota Twin Cities (2015)

M.S. Animal Sciences, Colorado State University (2022)

Research

My research studies nutrient flows from dairy production systems starting at the animal level. I am trained as a mixed methods researcher with a keen interest in the intersection of quantitative and qualitative efforts as they pertain to the sustainability of our food and agricultural systems. To answer the questions of interest to me surrounding sustainability and nutrient management, I employ process-based modeling software, field experiments, and qualitative methods to quantify best management practices in an effort to reduce the environmental impacts from the dairy sector.
