M.S. Animal Sciences, Colorado State University (2022)

Ph.D. Soil and Crop Sciences, Colorado State University (current, expected graduation Fall 2026)

Research

My work studies nutrient flows from food production systems starting at the animal level. I use process based modeling software in conjunction with field experiments to quantify best management practices in an effort to reduce the environmental impacts from the agriculture sector.
