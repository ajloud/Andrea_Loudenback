# About

Growing up in South Dakota exposed me to food systems on many fronts. Our town was surrounded by farmers and ranchers, close to several Smithfield and JBS Processing Plants, and home to my family's hotel and convenince food co-packing business. I knew from a young age that I wanted to pursue a career in research and academia with a focus on agriculture and food production.

In high school, I began to pay more attention to where my food came from. Who was the name behind the burger? What fields were the vegetables grown in? I drove past hundreds of acres of farmland daily, but was ignorant to the people who created their livelihood on that land. I set out to answer these questions and grow a deeper connection with not only the nutrients that I depend on, but the communities that I call home.

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at Colorado State University (CSU) where I actively foster connections with local producers and engage in community outreach to promote sustainable food production and choices aligned with local food consumption. I have grown a deep rooted sense of gratitude for the experiences, opportunities, and people that have facilitated my research over the past four years, and am committed to supporting the evolution of Northern Colorado food systems for many years to come.
