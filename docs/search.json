I am trained as a mixed methods researcher with a keen interest in the intersection of quantitative and qualitative efforts as they pertain to the sustainability of our food and agricultural systems. To answer the questions of interest to me surrounding sustainability and nutrient management, I employ process-based modeling software, field experiments, and qualitative methods to quantify best management practices in an effort to reduce the environmental impacts from the dairy sector.\nPublications\nConference Posters\n\n\n\nWestern Section American Society of Animal Science - presented at the 2021 annual meeting\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Dairy Science Association - presented at the 2023 annual meeting"
