I am trained as a mixed methods researcher with a keen interest in the intersection of quantitative and qualitative efforts as they pertain to the sustainability of our food and agricultural systems. To answer the questions of interest to me surrounding sustainability and nutrient management, I employ process-based modeling software, field experiments, and qualitative methods to quantify best management practices in an effort to reduce the environmental impacts from the dairy sector.\nDuring my thesis, I specifically focused on\nThroughout my undergrad I had the opportunity to be involved in several research projects."

    "text": "About\nGrowing up in South Dakota exposed me to food systems on many fronts. Our town was surrounded by farmers and ranchers, close to several Smithfield and JBS Processing Plants, and home to my family’s hotel and convenince food co-packing business. I knew from a young age that I wanted to pursue a career in research and academia with a focus on agriculture and food production.\nIn high school, I began to pay more attention to where my food came from. Who was the name behind the burger? What fields were the vegetables grown in? I drove past hundreds of acres of farmland everyday, but was ignorant to the people who created their livelihood on that land. I set out to answer these questions and grow a deeper connection with not only the nutrients that I depend on, but the communities that I call home.\nI am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at Colorado State University (CSU), actively fostering connections with local producers and engaging in community outreach to promote sustainable food production and choices aligned with local food values. I have grown a deep rooted sense of gratitude for the experiences, opportunities, and people that have facilitated my research over the past four years, and am committed to supporting the evolution of Northern Colorado food systems for many years to come.\nEducation\nB.S.
